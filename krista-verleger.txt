Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Inline elements can share a line with other elements if there is space. A block level element will, by default, begin on a new line and force anything after it to begin on another new line.
    
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        it will anchor itself as defined to the closest positioned element that came before. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Block: div, 
        Inline: span, img, 
        Inline-block: button

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The box model refers to how every element in HTML is wrapped in a box and CSS manages those boxes. A CSS reset will remove all default styling done by the browser.
